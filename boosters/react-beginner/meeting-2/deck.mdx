## Setup üõ†

1. Do the Boosters [Initial Setup](https://github.com/Accenture/digital-products-boosters#initial-setup) if you have not done so.

2. From the root of the `digital-products-boosters` repository, run:

```bash
$ cd boosters/react-beginner/meeting-2
$ git pull
$ asdf install
$ yarn install
$ yarn test # you should see failing tests
```

# Discussion Questions ü§î

---

# Discussion Question #1

What are the similarities and difference between props and state?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer Pt. 1

Props and state are both data which your component utilizes to render its
output.

They should both **not** be mutated directly. If this guideline is followed,
components become deterministic which means that given the same props and
state, a component renders the same output.

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer Pt. 2

State is declared in a component and can be updated immutably through a
callback function (i.e. `setState` in `useState` or `dispatch` in
`useReducer`). State usually represents data that changes in response to
certain events (i.e. user clicks, passage of time, etc.)

Props are always passed to a component.

---

# Discussion Question #2

How would you decided between using the `useState` hook vs the `useReducer`
hook?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #2 - Answer

It depends on how complex your overall state is. The following are some factors to consider:

- Number of states
  - _Are a lot of `useState` hooks present?_
- Number of update state callbacks passed down
  - _Are a lot of `setState` callbacks being passed down as props?_
- Co-dependency of state
  - _Does updating a piece of state depend on the value of another piece of state?_
  - _Are pieces of state frequently updated together?_

The more "yes" answers that you have, the more you should favor using `useReducer`

---

# Discussion Question #3

**Skip this question if you're new to React**

What are the benefits of hooks? Is there anything we can build now that we
could not before?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #3 - Answer Pt. 1

Everything that can be built with hooks can be done without hooks in React.
However, a lot of pain points have now been addressed.

Previously, to share code between components you would either use
Higher-Order Components or Render Props. These patterns added a lot of
complexity. Luckily, hooks allow us to replace these patterns with simple
functions.

---

# Discussion Question #3 - Answer Pt. 2

The component lifecycle was also confusing to a lot of developers. For
example, `componentWillReceiveProps` was often mis-used and there were a lot
of bugs caused by forgetting to handle prop changes in `componentDidUpdate`.
The `useEffect` hook (which will be covered in the next meeting) simplifies
and cosolidates this logic.

Also, classes in JavaScript have a lot of gotchas (i.e. `this`). While it's
important to learn these features, functions are much more robust. Functions
are easier to test, statically type, and reason about.

# Exercises üí™üèº

_N.B. You should be able to build the following components by getting the tests to pass. However, you can also run `yarn start` and go to [your local server](http://localhost:3000) to see what you're building_

---

# Exercise 0

1. Complete the [Setup](/2) if you haven't done so already.
2. Get the failing tests to pass, by updating component file(s) as necessary.
