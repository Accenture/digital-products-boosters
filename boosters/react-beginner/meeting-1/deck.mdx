## Setup üõ†

1. Do the Boosters [Initial Setup](https://github.com/Accenture/digital-products-boosters#initial-setup) if you have not done so.

2. From the root of the `digital-products-boosters` repository, run:

```bash
$ cd boosters/react-beginner/meeting-1
$ git pull
$ asdf install
$ yarn install
$ yarn test # you should see failing tests
```

# Discussion Questions ü§î

---

# Discussion Question #1

What is JSX? Can you write React without using JSX?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer

JSX is a syntax that allows developers write code that creates React elements
in a more visual and intuitive manner. JSX transpiles to JavaScript, so it's
possible to write React without JSX altogether.

Check out the next slide to see a side by side comparison of writing a
component with and without JSX.

# Discussion Question #2

What are props? What does it mean for props to be read-only?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #2 - Answer

Props are data that is used by the component to render. Props should be
treated as read-only, so they should not be mutated (i.e. if a prop is an
array, then we shouldn't call `push` on it because it mutates the array)
because props may be used by multiple components, and therefore mutating
props may lead to out-of-sync and/or incorrect component rendering outputs.

If props need to be manipulated, then a new object should be created with previous
properties copied over as desired (i.e. create a new array with all the
previous array elements plus a new element).

# Discussion Question #3

What is the purpose of the `key` prop in lists? What is an example of one bad value and one good value for a key prop?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #3 - Answer

The `key` prop allows React to uniquely identify a specific element in a
list. If the list is ever re-ordered, then React can use the `key` prop to
properly associate state with a specific element even if the list is
re-ordered. (State will be covered in a subsequent meeting)

A bad value for the `key` prop is the index value of the element in the list
because the value might change for a particular element if the list is ever
re-ordered. A good value for the `key` prop is a database primary key because
those tend to uniquely identify a specific record.
