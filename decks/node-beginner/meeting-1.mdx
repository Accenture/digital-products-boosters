## Setup üõ†

1. Do the Boosters [Initial Setup](https://github.com/Accenture/digital-products-boosters#initial-setup) if you have not done so.

2. From the root of the `digital-products-boosters` repository, run:

```bash
$ cd boosters/node-beginner/meeting-1
$ git pull
$ asdf install
$ yarn install
$ yarn test # You should see failing tests
```

# Discussion Questions ü§î

_To be discussed during the meeting_

---

# Discussion Question #1

- What is the benefit of using `async`/`await` over the `promise.then()` syntax?
- (True/False) All functions with the `async` keyword return a promise.

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer

- Using `async`/`await` avoids the ["callback hell" pattern](http://callbackhell.com/), in which functions become deeply nested in an attempt to maintain visually understandable code.
- True, `async` functions will return a promise object.

---

# Discussion Question #2

- When would you use a template literal over string concatenation?
- What are good examples of when tagged template literals can be used?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #2 - Answer

- Template literal allows us to write string that spans multiple lines and evaluate expressions in the string.

---

# Discussion Question #3

- Why would we use `module.exports` versus `exports`
- How are circular dependencies resolved?
- Why is `require()` synchronous and not asynchronous? What are the implications?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

<CodeLayout>

# Discussion Question #3 - Answer

- Initially both `module.exports` and `exports` point to the same object. You can add properties to this object by doing:
```JavaScript
module.exports.fname = 'John'
# or
exports.lname = 'Doe'
```

and the exported object will look like this:

```JavaScript
{fname: 'John', lname: 'Doe'}
```

  - However, if you re-assign a function, object, or what have you to `exports`, the reference to the same object is lost and now `module.exports` and `exports` point to two different objects. To avoid this pitfall, use `module.exports` or re-assign both of them: `exports = module.exports = function() {}`

- To resolve circular dependencies, we could remove one of the references or refactor the dependency. For examples, if we have:

```JavaScript
A -> B -> C - D -> A
```

  - We can break the circular dependency by removing `D -> A`. If we have `A -> B -> A`, we could refactor part of `B` into `A` or into `C` that both `A` and `B` reference, or combine both into a single module.
- Loading modules is done synchronously to ensure that they are initialized and ready when used.

# Exercises üí™üèº

_To be completed during the meeting_

Time to practice what you have learned from the readings.

---

# Exercise 0

1. Complete the [Setup](/2) if you haven't done so already.
2. Get the failing tests to pass by replacing the `"?"` with the expected value.

<MinuteTimer minutes={3} />

---

<CodeLayout>

# Exercise 0 - Answer

[Click to see answer]()

- var = function scope
- let/const = block scope

Variables declared with `var` are scoped to their execution context which is either the enclosing function or global. To visualize how `var` works, we can rewrite the function to:

```JavaScript
function generator(randomize) {
  var x;
  if (randomize) {
      x = Math.random();
      return x;
  }
  return x;
}
```

</CodeLayout>

---

# Exercise 1

1. Within the meeting folder, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in

```bash
01_exercise.test.js
```

2. Get the failing tests to pass by replacing the `"?"` with the expected value.

<MinuteTimer minutes={3} />

# Exercise 1 - Answer

[Click to see answer]()

```JavaScript
var_func(true);     \\ 5
var_func(false);    \\ undefined
const_func(true);   \\ undefined
const_func(false);  \\ undefined
```

`var_func` is the same as the function we have seen in exercise 0.

`x` in `const_func` is block-scoped within `if` statement block, therefore, calling `console.log(x)` will inevitably lead to a reference error.

# Exercise 2

1. Within the meeting folder, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in

```bash
02_exercise.test.js
```

2. Get the failing tests to pass by replacing the `"?"` with the expected value.

3. What does `this` reference in each case?

<MinuteTimer minutes={3} />

---

<CodeLayout>

# Exercise 2 - Answer

[Click to see answer]()

- In arrow function, `this` keyword is inherited
- In non-arrow functions, `this` keyword depends on the context it was called

<Split>
  <div>
  Case 1:

```JavaScript
myObject1.myMethod()
// -> this === window
```

  </div>

  <div>
  Case 2:

```JavaScript
myObject2.myMethod()
// -> this === myObject2
```

  </div>
</Split>

<Split>
  <div>
  Case 3:

```JavaScript
myObject3.myMethod()
myObject3.myArrowFunction()
// -> this === myObject3
```

  </div>

  <div>
  Case 4:

```JavaScript
myFunction()
// -> this === window
```

  </div>
</Split>

- For case 1 and 4, since both functions are arrow functions, `this` are inherited from parents which are the window object or global object.
- For case 2, the function is a non-arrow function, so `this` is implicitly bound to `myObject2`.
- For case 3, we called `myObject3.myMethod` to initialize `myObject3.myArrowFunction` to an arrow function. Since `myObject3.myMethod` is a non-arrow function and its `this` refers to `myObject3` (case 2), `myObject3.myArrowFunction` inherits the same `this` reference.

# Exercise 3

1. Within the meeting folder, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in

```bash
03_exercise.test.js
```

2. Get the failing tests to pass by replacing the `"?"` with the expected value.
3. What is the expected order of the outputs?

<MinuteTimer minutes={3} />

<CodeLayout>

# Exercise 3 - Answer

[Click to see answer]()

- The order of the output is:

```
two
three
four
one
```

TopLevel has to wait for level2 to resolved. level2 output `two` then resolve and output `three`. After that level3 is called and output `four`. Finally, the control is returned from level3 to level2 and to level1 where `one` is output.

# Exercise 4

1. Within the meeting folder, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in

```bash
04_exercise.test.js
```

2. Get the failing tests to pass by replacing the `"?"` with the expected value.

# Exercise 5

1. Within the meeting folder, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in

```bash
05_exercise.test.js
```

2. Get the failing tests to pass by replacing the `"?"` with the expected value.

<MinuteTimer minutes={3} />

<CodeLayout>

# Exercise 5 - Answer

[Click to see answer]()

Expected outputs are:

```JavaScript
main starting
a starting
b starting
in b, a.loaded = false done
in a, b.loaded = true
a done
{ bWasLoaded: true, loaded: true }
{ aWasLoaded: false, loaded: true }
```

`a` is required in `main`, then `a` in turn loads `b`. At this point, `b` tries to load `a`, and in order to prevent an infinite loop, `b` receives an partial copy of `a` (up to the line before `a` requires `b`), `b` assigns `a.loaded` (which is still false) to `aWasLoaded`, then finishes loading and return the exporting object to `a`.
