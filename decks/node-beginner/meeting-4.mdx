# Discussion Questions 🤔

_To be discussed during the meeting_

---

# Discussion Question #1

What is the purpose of using the `Body parser` middleware when retrieving information from the client?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer

NodeJS receives `POST` or `PUT` request data as a `ReadableStream` object. In order to access that data, you would need to read the stream into a Buffer, then convert it to a string (or whichever content type is being sent by the client). The `Body parser` middleware simplifies that process by handling that extract/conversion process, then attaching it to the `request` object for further middleware layers to use.
