## Setup üõ†

1. Do the Boosters [Initial Setup](https://github.com/Accenture/digital-products-boosters#initial-setup) if you have not done so.

2. From the root of the `digital-products-boosters` repository, run:

```bash
$ cd boosters/vue-beginner/meeting-1
$ git pull
$ asdf install
$ yarn install
$ yarn test # you should see failing tests
```

# Discussion Questions ü§î

_To be discussed during the meeting_

---

# Discussion Question #1

What is a directive? What are some application rendering behaviors made possible by directives?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer

Directives, which are prefixed with `v-`, are provided as html-attributes
in a Vue instance's template. When parsing your template into a DOM for your
browser, Vue recognizes these directives and is able to apply rendering behavior
that is reactive a component's state. There are many directives recognized by Vue,
but some of the most commonly used application behaviors they enable are:

- Binding html attributes to a Vue instance's state
- Conditionally rendering elements, or applying a loop to render a list of elements.
- Attaching event listeners to elements that invoke callback methods on a Vue instance.

---

# Discussion Question #2

Consider the left vue instance and template. What would you expect to render
before and after the two lines of code on the right run?

<Split>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
const vm = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: { name: 'Sophia' }
});
<div id="app">
  {{ name }} is {{ age }} years old.
</div>
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```
vm.name = 'Elliot';
vm.age = 31;
```

</Split>

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #2 - Answer

<Split>

**Before:** Sophia is years old.

**After:** Elliot is years old.

</Split>


Vue determines which data properties to be reactive to while rendering
the DOM when the instnace is first created. Because the `age` data prop was added after
the it's creation, it is not accessible during render.

This restriction eliminates edge cases, but it also enforces a good
maintainability practice. The `data` object should be treated as the
schema for your component's state. Declaring all reactive properties
up front makes your code easier to read for a future developer.

_*Note that attempting to render this undefined `age` property will cause
a warning to print to your console._

---

# Discussion Question #3

What is a computed property? Why would you define a computed property
instead of a method for rendering values in a template?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #3 - Answer

A computed property is a value calculated from one or more properties
in a Vue instance's `data` object. The value is set as the output of a
getter function defined in the `computed` object of the instance. Vue
will recalculate this value if a dependant `data` property changes.

<Split>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
function fullName() {
  return this.firstName +
  " " +
  this.lastName;
}
```

As a method, this `fullName` property would be recalculated on every single
rerender of the DOM. However as a computed property it's value would only update when
either `firstName` or `lastName` changes. This is especially valuable
for more expensive calculations.

# Exercise 0

In the `/boosters/vue-beginner/meeting-1` dir, run
```bash
yarn test exercise-0
```

Address the failing tests in `comment.vue` to build the `Comment` component.

---
# Exercise 0 Solution
```
<template>
  <div class="comment">
    <span>{{ text }}</span>
    <span>- {{ user.firstName }} {{ user.lastName }}</span>
  </div>
</template>
```
---

# Exercise 1

In the `/boosters/vue-beginner/meeting-1` dir, run
```bash
yarn test exercise-1
```
Address the failing tests in `comments_section.vue` to build the `CommentsSection` component.

---
# Exercise 1 Solution
```
<template>
  <div class="comments_section">
    <template v-if="comments && comments.length > 0">
      <div class="comment_item" :key="comment.id" v-for="comment in comments">
        <Comment :user="comment.user" :text="comment.text" />
      </div>
    </template>
    <template v-else>
      No comments
    </template>
  </div>
</template>
```
---
# Exercise 1 Bonus

Conditional rendering with a `template` element vs `div`.

<Split>

```
<div v-if="true">
  <div>Hello World</div>
</div>
//Compiles to:
<div>
  <div>Hello World</div>
</div>
```
```
<template v-if="true">
  <div>Hello World</div>
</template>
//Compiles to:

<div>Hello World</div>

```

</Split>

---

# Exercise 1 Double Bonus

[Do not use `v-if` and `v-for` on the same element](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Avoid-v-if-with-v-for-essential)

If you do `v-for` will be prioritized higher than `v-if`, which may cause unnecessary
expensive looping for a list that will not get rendered anyway. See this docs link for
a more detailed explanation.

---

# Exercise 2

In the `/boosters/vue-beginner/meeting-1` dir, run

```bash
yarn test exercise-2
```

Address the failing tests in `bike_image.vue` to build the `BikeImage` component.

---
# Exercise 2 Solution
```
<template>
  <div class="bike_image">
    <img :src="imageUrl" />
    <div>{{name}}</div>
    <CommentsSection :comments="comments" />
  </div>
</template>
```
---
# Exercise 3

In the `/boosters/vue-beginner/meeting-1` dir, run

```bash
yarn test exercise-3
```

Address the failing tests in `counter.vue` to build the `Counter` component.

Note that the bikes in your data include `increment` and `decrement` functions aleady.

---
# Exercise 3 Solution
```
<template>
  <div class="counter">
    <span class="btn decrementer" @click="bike.decrement()">-</span>
    <span class="total">{{ bike.qty }}</span>
    <span class="btn incrementer" @click="bike.increment()">+</span>
  </div>
</template>
```
---

# Exercise 4

In the `/boosters/vue-beginner/meeting-1` dir, run

```bash
yarn test exercise-4
```

---
# Exercise 4 Solution
```
<template>
  <div class="inventory">
    <div>Price: $ {{ bike.price }}</div>
    <Counter :bike="bike" />
    <div>Stock Value: $ {{stockValue}}</div>
  </div>
</template>
```
---

# Exercise 5

In the `/boosters/vue-beginner/meeting-1` dir, run

```bash

<template>
  <div class="bike_viewer">
    <button class="previous" @click="previousSlide()">PREVIOUS</button>
    <button class="next" @click="nextSlide()">NEXT</button>
    <BikeImage
      :comments="activeBike.comments"
      :name="activeBike.name"
      :image-url="activeBike.bikeImage"
    />
    <Inventory :bike="activeBike" />
