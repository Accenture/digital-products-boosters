## Setup 🛠

1. Do the Boosters [Initial Setup](https://github.com/Accenture/digital-products-boosters#initial-setup) if you have not done so.

2. From the root of the `digital-products-boosters` repository, run:

```bash
$ cd boosters/vue-beginner/meeting-1
$ git pull
$ asdf install
$ yarn install
$ yarn test # you should see failing tests
```

# Discussion Questions 🤔

_To be discussed during the meeting_

---

# Discussion Question #1

What is a directive? What are some application rendering behaviors made possible by directives?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer

Directives, which are prefixed with `v-`, are provided as html-attributes
in a Vue instance's template. When parsing your template into a DOM for your
browser, Vue recognizes these directives and is able to apply rendering behavior
that is reactive a component's state. There are many directives recognized by Vue,
but some of the most commonly used application behaviors they enable are:

- Binding html attributes to a Vue instance's state
- Conditionally rendering elements, or applying a loop to render a list of elements.
- Attaching event listeners to elements that invoke callback methods on a Vue instance.

---

# Discussion Question #2

Consider the left vue instance and template. What would you expect to render
before and after the two lines of code on the right run?

<Split>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
const vm = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: { name: 'Sophia' }
});
<div id="app">
  {{ name }} is {{ age }} years old.
</div>
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```
vm.name = 'Elliot';
vm.age = 31;
```

</Split>

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #2 - Answer

<Split>

**Before:** Sophia is years old.

**After:** Elliot is years old.

</Split>


Vue determines which data properties to be reactive to while rendering
the DOM when the instnace is first created. Because the `age` data prop was added after
the it's creation, it is not accessible during render.

This restriction eliminates edge cases, but it also enforces a good
maintainability practice. The `data` object should be treated as the
schema for your component's state. Declaring all reactive properties
up front makes your code easier to read for a future developer.

_*Note that attempting to render this undefined `age` property will cause
a warning to print to your console._

# Discussion Question #3

What is a computed property? Why would you define a computed property
instead of a method for rendering values in a template?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #3 - Answer

A computed property is a value calculated from one or more properties
in a Vue instance's `data` object. The value is set as the output of a
getter function defined in the `computed` object of the instance. Vue
will recalculate this value if a dependant `data` property changes.

<Split>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
function fullName() {
  return this.firstName +
  " " +
  this.lastName;
}
```

As a method, this `fullName` property would be recalculated on every single
rerender of the DOM. However as a computed property it's value would only update when
either `firstName` or `lastName` changes. This is especially valuable
for more expensive calculations.
