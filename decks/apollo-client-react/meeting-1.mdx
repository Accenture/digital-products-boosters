## Setup - Pt. 1 üõ†

1. Do the Boosters [Initial Setup](https://github.com/Accenture/digital-products-boosters#initial-setup) if you have not done so.

2. From the root of the `digital-products-boosters` repository, run:

```bash
$ cd boosters/apollo-client-react/meeting-1
$ git pull
$ asdf install
$ yarn install
$ yarn test # you should see failing tests
```

## Setup - Pt. 2 üõ†

1. [Create a Github personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token) if you have not done so.

2. In the meeting folder, set `REACT_APP_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` to your personal access token in the `.env.local` file.

# Discussion Questions ü§î

_To be discussed during the meeting_

---

# Discussion Question #1

What are the advantages of using Apollo Client over just making the API
calls directly to the GraphQL endpoint with the Fetch API?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer Pt. 1

The biggest advantage of Apollo client is that it features a cache that
normalizes all the graph data from your GraphQL endpoint. This greatly
decreases the amount of state management boilerplate code that you have to
write. If you have worked on a Redux application, then you have probably seen
that the state management boilerplate code comprises a significant amount of
the application (i.e. code for reducers, actions, selectors, normalizers, API
calls). By switching to Apollo client, the majority of this code could be
deleted.

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer Pt. 2

Additionally, Apollo Client has the following advantages:

- Automatically tracks loading and errors states
- Features a declarative React Hooks API
- Can unify local and remote data
- Can be customized for more advanced use cases

---

# Discussion Question #2

The following mutation is executed by Apollo Client and the server request is
successful. However, the todo's type is not updated in the front end.
If you refresh the page, then the todo's type will have the new value. Why is
this occuring?

```graphql
mutation UpdateTodo($id: String!, $type: String!) {
  updateTodo(id: $id, type: $type) {
    type
  }
}
```

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

<CodeLayout>

# Discussion Question #2 - Answer

Apollo client uses both the type and `id` of objects in the response to
normalize its cache. This bug is fixed simply by adding an `id` field to the
mutation even if the `id` is not explicitly used in the application code.
Once this is added, Apollo client will use this `id` to find the todo in its
cache and update its `type` value.

```graphql
mutation UpdateTodo($id: String!, $type: String!) {
  updateTodo(id: $id, type: $type) {
    id
    type
  }
}
```

FYI: This _could_ also be fixed by manually updating the cache after the
mutation is executed, but that approach adds unnecessary code and complexity.

# Discussion Question #3

What does the `skip` option of `useQuery` do?

<MinuteTimer minutes={3} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #3 - Answer

The `skip` options skips the execution of the query if the value is truthy.
This option would be useful if one of the non-null variables in the query
were to be `null` or `undefined` . In this case, you could refrain from
performing the query by using the `skip` option.
