## Setup üõ†

1. Do the Boosters [Initial Setup](https://github.com/Accenture/digital-products-boosters#initial-setup) if you have not done so.

2. From the root of the `digital-products-boosters` repository, run:

```bash
$ cd boosters/react-beginner/meeting-4
$ git pull
$ asdf install
$ yarn install
$ yarn test # you should see failing tests
```

# Discussion Questions ü§î

_To be discussed during the meeting_

---

# Discussion Question #1

What is a custom hook? Are there any restrictions in how to define a custom
hook and what is allowed in a custom hook?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer

A custom hook is a JavaScript function that uses primitive hooks or
other custom hooks within its function body. The custom hooks must still
follow the [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html).

Custom hooks will work without the `use` prefix. However, ommitting the
prefix should be discouraged because the linter uses this prefix to enforce
the Rules of Hooks.

---

# Discussion Question #2

The `useRef` hook can be used to create an object to reference a DOM node. A
more advanced use case of the hook is if you need a mutable value that can be
imperatively changed. What are some examples of when you need to use the
`useRef` hook for its advanced use case?

<MinuteTimer minutes={10} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #2 - Answer

The `useEffect` hook only has access to values from its current render such
as props and state. However, sometimes you may need values from a previous
render (i.e.
[usePrevious](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state))
or the latest render (i.e.
[useInterval](https://overreacted.io/making-setinterval-declarative-with-react-hooks/#just-show-me-the-code))
for a side effect. The `useRef` hook is needed here because its object can be
mutated to store a value across renders, and thus, the `useEffect` hook could
use the value in this object for these scenarios.

Having said this, a common beginner mistake is to use `useRef` for its
advanced usage when the `useState` hook would have sufficed. It is
recommended to first attempt to satisfy your use case with `useState` instead
of `useRef`. If `useState` suits your needs, then your code will be more
declarative and less error-prone.

# Exercises üí™üèº

_To be completed during the meeting_

_Pro Tip: You should be able to build the following components by getting the tests to pass. However, you can run `yarn start` and [visit your local server](http://localhost:3000) to see what you're building_

---

# Exercise 0

1. Complete the [Setup](/2) if you haven't done so already.
2. Get the failing tests to pass, by updating component file(s) as necessary.

<MinuteTimer minutes={10} />

# Exercise 1

1. Within the meeting folder, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in

```bash
src/exercises/exercise-1.test.js
```

2. Get the failing tests to pass, by updating component file(s) as necessary.

3. **Optional:** Run your local back end server by opening up a new terminal tab and running `yarn start-server` from the meeting folder.

_FYI: `john` is a username that is already taken_

<h1 style={{margin: 0}}>Exercise 2</h1>

1. Within the meeting folder, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in `src/exercises/exercise-2.test.js`

2. Get the failing tests to pass, by updating component file(s) as necessary.

3. **Optional:** Run your local back end server by opening up a new terminal tab and running `yarn start-server` from the meeting folder.

_Pro Tip: You will need to use the `fetchRepository` function from the `utils.js` file in the component folder_
