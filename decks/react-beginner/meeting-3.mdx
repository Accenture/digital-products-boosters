## Setup üõ†

1. Do the Boosters [Initial Setup](https://github.com/Accenture/digital-products-boosters#initial-setup) if you have not done so.

2. From the root of the `digital-products-boosters` repository, run:

```bash
$ cd boosters/react-beginner/meeting-3
$ git pull
$ asdf install
$ yarn install
$ yarn test # you should see failing tests
```

# Discussion Questions ü§î

_To be discussed during the meeting_

---

# Discussion Question #1

What is a side effect and what are some examples? Why must side effects be run inside the `useEffect` hook?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #1 - Answer

After invoking a function, any observable change besides the functioning
returning a value is a side effect. Some common examples of side effects are:

1. Making HTTP requests
2. Opening/closing Websocket connections
3. Starting/canceling timers
4. Adding/removing event listeners
5. Mutating the DOM

If effects are used outside the `useEffect` hook, then effects would be run
unexpectedly and would most likely not be properly cleaned up. This would
lead to problems such as memory leaks and invalid application state.

## Discussion Question #2

Is this component a good example of using the useEffect hook? Why or why not?

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const RepositoryWatchers = ({ owner, repository }) => {
  const [watchersCount, setWatchersCount] = useState(null);
  const getRepositoryWatchersCount = async () => {
    const url = "https://api.github.com/repos/" + owner + "/" + repository;
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const responseBody = await response.json();
    setWatchersCount(responseBody.watchers);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    getRepositoryWatchersCount();
  }, [getRepositoryWatchersCount]);

  return <div>{watchersCount} watchers</div>;
};
```

  <MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />
</CodeLayout>

---

# Discussion Question #2 - Answer Pt. 1

The component suffers from making an API call on every single render even if
the props remain unchanged. This occurs because even though
`getRepositoryName` is listed in the `useEffect` dependencies, the function
gets re-created on every render and thus, the effect runs on every render. To
prevent this from happening, the function should be declared inside the hook
_and_ the dependencies of the effect should be added (in this case `owner`
and `repository`). Check out the next slide for a correctly refactored
component.

P.S. Luckily, you don't have to ever worry about making this mistake if you
have a linter because it will warn you about this.

## Discussion Question #2 - Answer Pt. 2

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const RepositoryWatchers = ({ owner, repository }) => {
  const [watchersCount, setWatchersCount] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const getRepositoryWatchersCount = async () => {
      const url = "https://api.github.com/repos/" + owner + "/" + repository;
      const response = await fetch(url);
      const responseBody = await response.json();
      setWatchersCount(responseBody.watchers);
    };

    getRepositoryWatchersCount();
  }, [owner, repository]);

  return <div>{watchersCount} watchers</div>;
};
```

# Discussion Question #3

What is the purpose of the `useRef` hook?

<MinuteTimer minutes={5} isDiscussion />

---

# Discussion Question #3 - Answer

The most common and safe usage of the `useRef` hook is to create an object
whose `.current` property will reference a DOM node corresponding to an HTML
React element. This is done by passing the object returned by `useRef` as a
`ref` prop to an HTML React element (i.e. `<div ref={myRef} />`).

The less common and more advanced use case is if you need a mutable value
that is imperatively changed. Before going down this path, it is recommended
to first attempt to satisfy your use case with `useState` instead of
`useRef`. If `useState` suits your needs, then your code will be more
declarative and less error-prone.

# Exercises üí™üèº

_To be completed during the meeting_

_Pro Tip: You should be able to build the following components by getting the tests to pass. However, you can run `yarn start` and [visit your local server](http://localhost:3000) to see what you're building_

---

# Exercise 0

1. Complete the [Setup](/2) if you haven't done so already.
2. Get the failing tests to pass, by updating component file(s) as necessary.

_Pro Tip: You will need to use the `fetchRepository` function in `utils.js` to make the API call. By default it will fake a network request. However, **only after getting the tests to pass**, you can update the `shouldUseRecordedResponse` variable to `false` to perform a real network call to the Github API_

---

# Exercise 1

1. Within the meeting folder, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in

```bash
src/exercises/exercise-1.test.js
```

2. Get the failing tests to pass, by updating component file(s) as necessary.

_Pro Tip: You will need to use the `makePercentage` and `drawProgressBar` functions in `utils.js` to draw the progress bar with [D3](https://d3js.org/)._

<h1 style={{margin: 0}}>Exercise 2</h1>

1. Within the meeting folder, change `xdescribe` to `describe` in `src/exercises/exercise-2.test.js`

2. Get the failing tests to pass, by updating component file(s) as necessary.

3. **Optional** run a local WebSocket server by opening up a new terminal tab and running `yarn start-server` from the meeting folder.

Also here are some helpful resources on WebSockets:

- [creating a WebSocket client](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications#Examples)
- [receiving a message](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications#Receiving_messages_from_the_server)
- [closing the connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications#Closing_the_connection)
